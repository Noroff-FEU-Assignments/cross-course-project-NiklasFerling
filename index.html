    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advice you to first protect against the most common threats. This includes, but is not limited to; Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery just to name a few. To protect your site against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) you should start by disabling markup that can run scripts entered by a user in things like a search bar, comment section et cetra.</p>
