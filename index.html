    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advice you to first protect against the most common threats. This includes, but is not limited to; Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery just to name a few. To protect your site against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) you should start by disabling markup that can run scripts entered by a user in things like a search bar, comment section et cetra.</p>
    <p>Cross-Site request Forgery</p>
=======
    <p id="web-security-answer">To secure your web application from the most normal and malicious attacks, I would start my focus on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and SQL Injection. 

      <p id="web-security-answer">The most effective measure to defend against XSS is simply to disable elements like "embed", "script", "object" and "link" as these give instructions to run code.
      </p>
      <p id="web-security-answer">A way of defending against CSRF threats, is to make the server require a user-specific secret that is generated by the server. That way it makes it much harder for an attacker to make a form for every user. 
      </p>
      <p id="web-security-answer">To defend against SQL Injection, make sure that all information passed in the SQL query can’t change the query itself. A simple way to do this is to “escape” everything in the user input that means something in SQL.
